notes from bryce session


AJAX
insted of only clicking links javascript triggers a certain request instead of sending request / response to server.


Change so that we are on the same page when adding todo items.
1. change _form to remote: true instead of local
2. remove the re_direct method in the index action of the controller
3. in the action create in the controller add   --->   format.html { redirect_to tasks_url } #could also be redirect_to action: :index


Add jquery library to rails:

1. add jquery to gemfile
2. bundle install
3. in application.js --> //= require jquery
  3.1. in the console write "jQuery" to see if it worked. No errors means you got Jquery working.


jquery
1. Add bootstrap cdn + add the html you want in the index view.
2. touch file edit.js in the same view folder.
3. Go to tasks.js (see all that )
  3.1. here add the jquery that you wnat to use on the html element
